# Documentation
The libraries that I've used are the following:

* DayJS
* TailwindCSS
* React-Simple-Maps

## Libraries / Setup
I used DayJS since it's a small utility tool when working with Dates and I've had some good experiences with it in the past.

I chose TailwindCSS since I really love their approach with designing/developing the frontend. Its the CSS atomic style we're familiar with from previous frameworks yet it doesn't enforce a certain 'style' on you. You're quite flexible to change how it works.

I went with a Functional Components approach because, in my experience, it's the latest trend in the React community. For state management I've went with Hooks since I've been working with them for a recent project and it's also quite new in the React environment. I quite like the simplicity of Hooks, especially if I compare it with my experience with NGRX, RXJS or Vuex.

I never used React-Simple-Maps before but it looked decent enough judging from the documentation.

## What I chose
I picked the user stories which I know I could finish in time and which would give the user a sense of a small working application. The purpose of the web application is to fetch launch dates and to plot them on the map. By giving the user the option to change the start and end date they're in control on what they can view. A small addition is to show the first launch according to their given start date.

I didn't pick the filtering user stories because if the web application would only have a small portion of the filtering possibilities it would feel like an incomplete tool in my opinion.

## What I would have done differently
I would have opted for a more simple approach to the map solution. I've spent a bit too much time on the documentation (regarding the markers and making it work with Typescript). My approach would be to search for more solutions instead of opting for the first one I found which looked good.
